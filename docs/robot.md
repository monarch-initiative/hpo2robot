# ROBOT

    [ROBOT](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3002-3){:target="_blank"}. is Tool for Automating Ontology Workflows. The hpo2robot application is a GUI that streamlines the generation of input files for ROBOT.


## To discuss

- what should the final format of the table be?
- at what point of the pipeline should we be generating new term IDs and how can we tell Protege which IDs we have consumed?



Note that not all of these items will be shown in the table. The HPO id of the parent term will be shown
as a mouse-over hover, and the ORCID id is constant. The comment, synony, crossreferences will not be shown in the table,
and only the first 30 characters of the definition will be shown, followed by ellipsis.
To see all the data for any given row, the user will need to mark the row and then the entire
set of new data will be shown in the bottom left part of the GUI in a WebView.
